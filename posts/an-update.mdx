# Introduction

I just want to start of this post by talking about where I have been and where I'll be going. Right now in life, I am in my final years of high school and I will be sitting my finals in May 2022. After I've completed my finals, I have a 3 month break before I start college. In those 3 months, All my focus will be on [Nord Studio](https://nordstud.io) and a few personal projects like [Cookie](https://github.com/tygerxqt/Cookie) and this website. After those 3 months, I'll be starting college where I will be taking a course in Game Design. Hopefully this course will lead me down a path where I can create and deliever incredible stories and immersive experiences.

## What I'm focusing on

After I have finished writing and publishing this blog post, I'll be working on the following:

**Finishing Cookie's TypeScript re-write.**

- This will allow [tyger's valley](https://dsc.gg/tyger) to be fully secure with advanced moderation.
- There will be more "fun" events and commands available like Ranks and an economy.
- More user interaction like movie / game nights.

**Refurbishing the Nord Studio community.**

- Creating Cookie's brother, Artemis.
- Correctly setting up channels, permissions etc.
- ~~An area where members can suggest ideas and new features?~~ ðŸ‘€

**An update to tygr.dev.**

- A full re-write in TypeScript.
- Adding accounts for future features like blog comments and additional perks when you donate.
- A new and clean look.

And of course, my final exams.

## When will you be back?

I officially leave high school on June 2022 and start my 3 month break as stated before. After the 3 month break, I start my college course in September 2022. I should be back fully to develop and work on my college course at the same time, but I guess only time can tell *Â¯\\*(ãƒ„)*/Â¯*

## Blog updates

Hopefully, I will be able to make more blog posts like this to keep you all updated on how I'm doing. But that is a **hard** maybe, I'll only make posts if I have the time.

## New logo!?

Oh yeah, one last thing before I head out. I have made myself an official logo. A branding page will be avalible with the new website by the way. Here's a preview!
