# Introduction.

Hello all! I've been working a lot on this account system. Sorry for the updates being so basic and slow, this is my first time making a system like this so I am taking very careful precautions and making sure all data is safe and secure.

## Moved route.

I notice that your profile is viewed and edited on the `/account` route? Yeah, strange. So I have moved the profile to the correct route, `/profile`. The `/account` route will be used for another purpose later.

## Avatars!

You can now add an avatar to your tygr.dev account! Simply go to [tygr.dev/profile](https://tygr.dev/profile) and upload an avatar, also you can remove it. GIF support will be added in the next update.

## Editable fields.

At last, you can change your e-mail address and username. Be sure to claim your username before it's taken. The ability to change your password will be added in the next update. If you have forgotten your password, please DM me and I will manually trigger a password reset. 

## Upcoming changes.

The new update will feature a lot more to the profile system, features **may** include:
- Tagging system to let users have the same username (tygerxqt#1234)
- Link your `Discord` and `Github` account for easier login and extra features.
- Link your `tygr.dev` account to [Cookie](https://github.com/tygerxqt/cookie).
- Blog comments.
- Badges (Early supporter, Beta, Pixel subscriber, etc)
- 2FA to secure your account further.
- GIF support for avatars.
- Express contacting for specific projects (Ideas, Suggestions, Bug reports)
- Billing component to move [ko-fi.com/tygerxqt](https://ko-fi.com/tygerxqt) to the website.
