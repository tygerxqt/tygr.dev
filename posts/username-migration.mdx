# tyger796.
- `tyger796` doesn't go well with a domain name (tyger796.com, tyger796.dev).
- `tyger796` doesn't look very professional.
- `tyger796` has numbers, who has numbers in their name?!
- I've had this username since I was 7 years old. I'm bored of it now.

# tygerxqt.
- `tygerxqt` does go well with a domain.
- It's the same length as `tyger796`
- It sounds cool.
- Sounds more natural to say.

# Conclusion
I like the username `tyger796`. It's simple and small.
However, `tygerxqt` is even better.
