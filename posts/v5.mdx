Hello everyone. It's been a busy few months since I last updated tygr.dev. I started my college course, got a job, and spent a lot of time focusing on my mental health. During this time, I took a step back, re-evaluated the state of tygr.dev, and created a plan to build it again from the ground up. But this time, I wanted to set some rules.  

1. Resist the temptation of using a bunch of npm packages; I will only use them for things I cannot create by myself, like heavy UI components or services like `contentful` and `react-icons.`
2. Enforce the use of [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/overview#streaming-ssr) wherever I can to increase performance and security.
3. Attempt to use native web practices. Using `fetch()` instead of a 3rd party package like `axios`, using real CSS property names in component styling, etc.  

I've kept most of the features from v3 and v4 but enhanced them with these rules in mind, which makes v5 a bold, fast, and responsive platform for showcasing my work and skills. In this post, I'll review the key improvements that make tygr.dev v5 stand out compared to older versions.

## A Bold, Formal, and Consistent Design.

The first thing you'll notice about tygr.dev v5 is a bold but formal design that conveys a similar feel to my logo. I wanted to give tygr.dev a consistent look and feel throughout so it's instantly recognisable and easy to understand. Black and white are the primary colours because it'll make the site look minimalist while making essential elements like buttons and links stand out, allowing users to recognize that they are interactable without any confusion.

## Faster than fast, quicker than quick. 

As previously mentioned, I wanted to ensure that most of the site uses server-side rendering to deliver fast and efficient performance, regardless of device or network speed. This means that tygr.dev loads quickly and smoothly, providing an excellent experience for all visitors. Additionally, all API routes and components will be regularly updated and revised for ultimate speed.

## One size fits all.

Before I started the plan for v5, I read an [interesting article from wix.com](https://www.wix.com/blog/2022/07/mobile-first-design/) which claims that most of the internet traffic is, in fact, mobile clients.

> With over 80% of internet users surfing the web on mobile devices and up to 70% of web traffic coming from mobile devices, you must optimize your website for mobile use, regardless of your industry or niche.

80%?! That is insane! That percentage drove me to ensure that while developing v5, I would start creating the UI with mobile dimensions first and scale up. Whether you're visiting tygr.dev on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, you'll get the same great experience, no matter what.

## Additions.
While a lot of the pages and components in v5 have been taken from older versions and remade, there are a few additions I want to make to the new version. Here's a list of them:
* A new footer with a Spotify live listening component.
* Flexible API routes with Documentation.
* Server-side rendered MDX.
* Custom 404 / 500 pages.
* A "Stories," "Photography," and "Snippets" page.
* A feedback button / chat.

## Conclusion.

Version 5 brings on a new, bold, and speedy experience for all devices on all internet speeds.
